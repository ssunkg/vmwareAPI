SimpleGraphs is a Java library designed to make it easy to visualize
real-time data in AWT or Swing. 

Use the GraphConfiguration object to configure the properties of the
graph. For an example of how to do this, see GraphDemo.java. To see it
in action, run "ant run".

To build a jarfile for distribution, run "ant dist". The resulting
jarfile will be placed in the dist/ directory.
